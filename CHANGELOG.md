# What's New in This App Update?

We've squashed some bugs and made some improvements to make the app run smoother for you! Here's a quick rundown:

**Improved App Functionality:**

- **Task Completion**: We fixed an issue where tasks might incorrectly show 100% complete when switching to a new month if they were empty.
- **Attendance Tracking**: We identified a problem where changing your device time could mess up your personal attendance data. This is fixed now!
- **Task Titles**: We've removed the capitalization formatting from task titles for a cleaner look.
- **Task Details**: You can now see the date a task was created in its details view.
- **Organization QR Codes**: Organization QR codes are now encoded for better scanning. (QR codes are those square barcodes you can scan with your phone's camera)
- **Uploading QR Codes**: You can now upload QR codes directly within the app using the new upload button and function.
- **Check-in/Out Confirmation**: The option button for check-in/out confirmation has been moved from the Attendance screen to the Settings menu for easier access.

**Backend Fix:**

- **Leave Cancellation**: We resolved an issue where staff members were unable to cancel leave requests due to a permission error.
